# AminoacidCounter
Aminoacids counter and sequence generator for Molegro's *.mol2 files.

Usage:
Download AminoacidCounter.exe from [bin/Debug] directory or compile my project.
In command prompt, enter
AminoacidCounter.exe file.mol2
where "file.mol2" is your exported protein.
Few moments after, results will be saved in same folder as AminoacidCounter app was downloaded.

You can also simply drag and drop your *.mol2 file on AminoacidCounter.exe.

At this moment, AminoacidCounter supports ONLY *.mol2 files. Need more time to add support for another file formats.
