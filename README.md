# AminoacidCounter
Amino Acids counter and sequence generator for *.mol2 (Molegro) and *.pdb files.

Usage:
Download AminoacidCounter.exe from [bin/Debug] directory or compile my project.
In command prompt, enter

AminoacidCounter.exe file.mol2

where "file.mol2" is your exported protein.
After few moments, results will be saved in same folder where AminoacidCounter was downloaded.

You can also simply drag and drop your *.mol2 or *.pdb file on AminoacidCounter.exe.

At this moment, AminoacidCounter supports *.mol2 files, and, in BETA stage, *.pdb.
Notify me, if you need another file format support.
