# AminoacidCounter
Aminoacids counter and sequence generator for *.mol2 (Molegro) and *.pdb files.

Usage:
Download AminoacidCounter.exe from [bin/Debug] directory or compile my project.
In command prompt, enter
AminoacidCounter.exe file.mol2
where "file.mol2" is your exported protein.
Few moments after, results will be saved in same folder as AminoacidCounter app was downloaded.

You can also simply drag and drop your *.mol2/*.pdb file on AminoacidCounter.exe.

At this moment, AminoacidCounter supports *.mol2 files, and, in EXPERIMENTAL stage, *.pdb.
Need more time to add support for another file formats.
